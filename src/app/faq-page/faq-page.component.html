            <p class="subhead">Who are you?</p>
            <p class="response">
                I'm Alex Hinton, a computer scientist in my fourth year of study at New College of Florida.
                I am working on BTS-Dash with Dr. Tania Roy, Assistant Professor of Human Centered Computing
                at NCF.

            <p class="subhead">Why did you make this?</p>
            <p class="response">
                The initial website was a final project for Dr. Tania Roy's Software Engineering class 
                in the Spring 2021 semester at NCF. This website, which is a continuation
                of that project, is an exercise in bringing together information on one subject from across
                many different social media platforms. BTS, which has a social media following and subsequent 
                online presence of nigh unheard of proportions, is an ideal topic for this.

            <p class="subhead">Where did your data come from?</p>
            <p class="response">
                The two Twitter feeds and the graph of the likes and retweets in #bts on Twitter are both
                being pulled directly from Twitter with their API. The graph of Butter's audio features and the 
                charts for the top tracks on Spotify according to country are being pulled directly from
                Spotify also using their API. The live counters are all from either 
                <a href="https://livecounts.io"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">livecounts.io</a>
                or from 
                <a href="https://mixerno.space" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mixerno.space</a>, 
                as marked. The Twitter feeds and graph will update daily at 12 AM EST, and the live counters 
                update every ten seconds.

            <p class="subhead">I have comments about this. How do I contact you?</p>
